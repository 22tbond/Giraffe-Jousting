  <h1>World Hunger
  </h1>
  <h2>How this is affecting people/ how to fix the problem:</h2>

  <p1> This is affecting people becuase 1 in every 7 people go home hungry, thats over 795 million people in the world not getting a healthy amount of food.</p1>

<p2> How can we fix this? We can try to fix world hunger by giving away wasted food, 1/3 of food is wasted. We can also give out more food stamps and open more homeless shelters.</p2>
